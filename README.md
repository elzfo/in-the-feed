## 🎮 Play the Game

This is a web-based game prototype built with React and Tailwind CSS.

### **How to Play**
1. **Objective**: Survive your 3-minute shift as a content moderator during a high-stakes election.
2. **Controls**:
   - **Swipe/Click Red Posts**: Remove misinformation and viral fake news.
   - **Ignore Green/Neutral Posts**: Let legitimate news flow.
   - **Watch Your Energy**: Removing posts costs energy. Don't burn out!
3. **Losing Condition**: If too much misinformation slips through, the "Toxicity" meter fills up, and the system collapses.
